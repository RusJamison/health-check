Two out of three people over the age of 50 years has High Blood Pressure and if unchecked could be fatal. Early detection is the key and technology is on our side.

- We are the most fortunate and informed habitants to live on planet earth.

- Integrated Circuits (IC) technology has improved greatly over the past ten years, making medical equipment accurate, smarter, reliable and easy to use in home setting.

To minimize unnecessary visits to the doctors for our aging population the basic patient vital monitoring can now be done easily at home. The availability of basic medical equipment which is affordable, cheap and equally acurate can be easily used and results shared with doctors using remote monitoring. Since information storage is now cheap also due to IC technology the patient vital signs measurements can be stored and shared with doctors during the next visit. This wealth of information will assist the doctors to come with better outcomes for the patient.
