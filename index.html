                Health Check at Home
            </h3>
            <p>
                We are the most fortunate and informed habitants to live on planet earth.
            </p>

            <p>
                Integrated Circuits (IC) technology has improved greatly over the past ten years, making medical equipment accurate, smarter, reliable and easy to use in home setting.
            </p>

            <p>
                To minimize unnecessary visits to the doctors for our aging population the basic patient vital monitoring can now be done easily at home.
                The availability of basic medical equipment which is affordable, cheap and equally acurate can be easily used and results shared with doctors using remote monitoring.
                Since information storage is now cheap also due to IC technology the patient vital signs measurements can be stored and shared with doctors during the next visit.
                This wealth of information will assist the doctors to come with better outcomes for the patient.

                Human Nature Resistance To Visit Doctors For Medical Checkup
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    72 percent of respondents said they would rather be doing household chores, like cleaning toilets than going to the doctor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    65 percent of respondents said avoid going to the doctor as long as possible
                </li>
            </ul>
                <p>
                    This human behaviour is an ongoing issue which is costly at the end. It keeps the doctors from detecting life-threating issues early.
                    This results in bigger health issues and sometimes death. This is why Health check monitoring at home is recommended.
